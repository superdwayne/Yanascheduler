This project was created so that people could book time to meet our baby

## How does it work?

So on the front end you have a React build.
On the back end you have an node express server.

So when you use the form you post the information to the back end, and at the same time you reteive the infomation on the front end.

### `yarn dpm`

This will fire up the back end and front end in one command

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
