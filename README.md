# Yana Sechduler

This project was created so that people could book time to meet our baby



## The set up

So on the front end you have a React build and on the back end you have an node express server.

## How does it work?

There is a HTML form on the front end, when the form is completed the information is sent to the back end, and retrived at the same time to display on the front end

Lastly an email is send letting one know they have a new booking.

### `yarn dpm`

This will fire up the back end and front end in one command

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
